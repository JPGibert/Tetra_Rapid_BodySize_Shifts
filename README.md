  1) Food_webs.zip with all used food webs
  2) fw_descriptor.r, R code with that quantifies structural aspects of food webs and outputs to file
  3) FW_global_pattern.r, R code where the analyses are performed
  4) Food_web_metadata.csv file needed for FW_global_pattern
  5) struct_data.csv file also needed for FW_global_pattern to run but that can be generated using fw_descriptor.r
